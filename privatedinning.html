        <p>In summary, a chef is a skilled professional who combines culinary expertise, creativity, and leadership to
            create extraordinary dining experiences. They are responsible for menu planning, recipe development,
            ingredient sourcing, food preparation, kitchen management, and team leadership</p>

        <h3>OENOS ROOM</h3><br><br>
        <hr>
        <hr><br><br><br>
        <p>Adjacent to the Kouzina is the Oenos or “wine” room. This is one of Kokkari’s two private dining rooms. This
            room features large windows that look out on to Jackson Street and a dramatic wall of wine racks that spans
            floor to ceiling. The large, wood-framed, sliding glass doors that separate the Oenos Room from the main
            dining area allow guests to feel part of the restaurant while still being in a private space. This room can
            accommodate 30 people.</p>

        <h3>HANIA</h3><br>

        <p>
            This unique private dining room is located downstairs and is completely separate from the main dining area.
            The room has the feel of a wine cellar with warm wood accents and rich, tapestry carpets. It features a
            rectangular polished wood table that accommodates up to 10 people comfortably. The Hania Room is ideal for
            small business meetings and intimate family functions.</p>
